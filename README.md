SimplePassive is a resource for FiveM that allows you to use a Passive Mode like feature just like in GTA Online.

It has multiple configurable features that you can configure and use, like:

* Authorizing specific players via ACL permissions (for example: only staff members can use passive)
* Forcing passive mode onto players (to prevent harassment or ramming with vehicles)
* Disable combat between players (for the true passive mode experience)

## Download

* [GitHub](https://github.com/justalemon/SimplePassive/releases)
* [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/justalemon/simplepassive) (experimental)

## Installation

In your **resources** directory, create a folder called **simplepassive** and extracts the contents from the compressed file in there.

## Usage

By default, SimplePassive does not allows users to enable or disable passive mode. You need to authorize it via the `simplepassive.changeself` ACL permission. Then, passive mode can be toggled via the /passivetoggle command.

Feel free to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/justalemon/SimplePassive/wiki) for a list of Commands, Convars and Exports.
